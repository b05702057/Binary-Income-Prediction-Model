# Machine-Learning-Classification
In this project, I implemented two model, the generative model and the logistic regression model. To improve the accuracy, I tried three main operations. First of all, I did tiral and error to find the best feature combination. Also, I normalized all the data in the numpy array. Lastly, I tried regularizations to avoid overfitting.
